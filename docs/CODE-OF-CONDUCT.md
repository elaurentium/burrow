# Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

# Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
Examples include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

# Enforcement

All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
